# SocketIO Examples for SquadJS

With this short repo/guide I did try to show how you can use the socketIO connection with your SquadJS server.
<br><br>This repo will be updated from time to time with more examples and with a UI version of the guide.
<br><br>
The current guide is at the `main.js` file
